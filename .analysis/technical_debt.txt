# Technical Debt Snapshot â€“ 2025-09-20

Sources: `.eggs/egg.001.meta-process-implementation.txt`, `docs/procs/BACKLOG.md`, `docs/procs/TASKS.txt`

## High Priority
- ROOM-609: Socket streaming + response channel (blocked on Meteor/ASC100 protocol finalisation).
- ROOM-603/604: Structured logging + metrics scaffolding and Criterion harness integration need completion + documentation updates.

## Medium Priority
- ROOM-611: Dependency refresh sweep for runtime crates (blake3, crossterm, serde family, unicode-width, strip-ansi-escapes).
- ROOM-612/613: Runtime bootstrap helpers and focus defaults to improve first paint + prompt handling.

## Process Debt
- Keep `bin/validate-docs.sh` aligned with new docs as they are added or renamed; treat validator warnings as must-fix before handoff.
- Expand developer guide/troubleshooting (ROOM-502) once meta-process stabilises; integrate results into `docs/ref/`.
