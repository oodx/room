# Room Roadmap (High-Level)



## Phase 1 – Layout Engine MVP (Complete)
- Constraint solver, zone registry, ANSI renderer.
- Chat demo showcasing selective updates and footer input.
- Documentation in `docs/STRATEGY.md`; pending clean-up tracked in `BACKLOG.md`.

## Phase 2 – Runtime & Plugins (In Progress)
- Build `RoomRuntime` coordinator with event loop and lifecycle hooks.
- Formalize plugin system; extract chat/workshop behaviors into reusable modules.
- Ship structured logging + metrics and Criterion benchmarks for regression tracking.

## Phase 3 – Declarative Layout & Batteries Included UX
- Create layout DSL/compiler for zone declarations and plugin wiring.
- Provide standard components: chat panes, status bars, boxy window manager, split panes.
- Expand workshops/examples to demonstrate token-compliant patterns.

## Phase 4 – Adapters & Integrations
- CLI driver (crossterm), socket/WebSocket driver, and scripted test harness.
- Explore tmux-like controller, chat server integration, and remote session support.
- Package runtime plugins/adapters for reuse across OODX projects.

## Phase 5 – Observability & Scaling
- Deep-dive profiling, runtime diagnostics dashboard, replay tooling.
- Long-running soak tests feeding synthetic workloads.
- Hardening for multi-plugin coexistence and backpressure handling.
