# Workshop · Multi-Screen Flow Control

Walk through a three-screen Room runtime that shares configuration state,
keeps per-screen visit counters, and records an activity log that survives
navigation. This is the companion for SCREEN-106.

## Launch

```bash
cargo run --example workshop_screen_multiscreen
```

## Exercises

1. **Tour the dashboard** – Start on the dashboard screen and note the shared
   configuration snapshot (theme + notification toggle) alongside the activity
   feed. Switch screens with `Ctrl+Tab`, `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`, or jump with digits
   `1`/`2`/`3`.
2. **Tweak settings** – Move to the settings screen (`2` or `Ctrl+Tab`) and
   press `t` to flip the theme or `n` to toggle notifications. Watch how the
   dashboard reflects the change once you return.
3. **Inspect the activity log** – Visit the activity screen and observe the
   live history generated by screen activations and settings updates. Press `c`
   to clear the log and confirm a new entry indicates the reset.
4. **Trigger screen-driven navigation** – Use convenience shortcuts: `s` on the
   dashboard opens settings, `a` on any screen jumps to the activity feed, and
   `d` returns to the dashboard. These requests go through
   `ScreenState::navigator()` without touching the runtime directly.

## Takeaways

- Each screen owns a `ScreenState` namespace keeping its visit counter scoped to
  that screen.
- Shared runtime state (`SharedAppState`) lives behind `RuntimeContext::shared_init`
  so configuration and activity logs survive screen switches.
- The workshop highlights how navigation defaults (`Ctrl+Tab`, `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`)
  combine with custom shortcuts exposed via the navigator helper.
- Clearing history or toggling settings demonstrates cross-screen feedback: one
  screen mutates state while another renders the results immediately.

## Next Steps

- Extend the example with additional screens (e.g., analytics) to practice
  composing complex flows.
- Build scripted tests that simulate the key presses used in the workshop to
  guard against regressions in navigation or shared-state behaviour.
- Feed audit output into the activity log to show how bootstrap events surface
  across screens once the audit helper integrates with multi-screen flows.
