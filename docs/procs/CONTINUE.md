# Continue Log – main · Runtime Audit & First-Paint Prototypes

## Summary
- Added a cursor utility module so demos/tests can compose ANSI cursor sequences without ad hoc escape codes.
- Added a bootstrap control helper (`BootstrapControls`) so runtimes can delay first render, pump ticks, or gate on events before drivers take over.
- Added a bootstrap audit helper that buffers lifecycle events until the first render commits and wired both audit demos through it.
- Added a lifecycle audit module (`runtime::audit`) plus runtime hooks so stages stream to custom sinks.
- Introduced `examples/runtime_first_paint.rs` to force an immediate render and spotlight audit output for onboarding.
- Replaced the prompt scratchpad with `examples/audit_demo.rs` – a Boxy dashboard that consumes the audit feed once the first frame paints.
- Wired audit re-exports through `lib.rs` and updated `chat_demo` to cover the expanded `RuntimeEvent` match.
- Logged follow-up tasks (ROOM-612/613) for formalising bootstrap helpers and default focus handling.
- Finalised the SCREEN-101 spec with lifecycle diagrams, risks, and migration plan (`docs/ref/strat/SCREEN_ZONE_STRATEGY.md`).
- Scaffolded the `ScreenManager` (SCREEN-102) with activation APIs, lifecycle hooks, and event routing while keeping single-screen flows intact.
- Added a `LegacyScreenStrategy`, exported the toolkit, and updated `chat_demo` to activate the screen manager during startup to prove the legacy flow survives.
- Migrated `audit_demo`, `boxy_dashboard_runtime`, `control_room`, `runtime_first_paint`, `bootstrap_helper`, `workshop_room_bootstrap`, `chat_workshop`, and `boxy_dashboard` to the legacy screen strategy and confirmed they compile via `bin/examples.sh` so scripted launches keep working.
- Validator still passes; process docs remain the single entry points (START/PROCESS/QUICK_REF updated).

## Current Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Phase**: Runtime & Plugin Phase 2 (observability + first paint prototypes)
- **Progress**: Audit infrastructure and demos landed with first-frame gating; cursor utilities + bootstrap workshop shipping; screen manager now exercised via the chat demo; meta-process scaffolding stable; reference sweep still queued.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Spec default focus wiring (ROOM-613) so prompt-style plugins can declare their target zone without manual controllers.
2. Extend SCREEN-102 by migrating the remaining demos/bundles onto the screen manager and adding focused activation tests.
3. Draft the multi-screen workshop plan (SCREEN-106) so we can exercise the manager once demos are migrated.
4. Finish the documentation/reference sweep and record the pass in DONE once complete.
5. Exercise `audit_demo`, `runtime_first_paint`, the new `bootstrap_helper`, and `workshop_room_bootstrap` across terminals; capture any ANSI glitches as follow-up issues.
6. Document bootstrap control usage in reference notes and migrate existing demos if further alignment is needed (cursor helpers now available).

## Blockers / Risks
- Residual stale references may exist outside the primary process docs; they could confuse the next agent if left unchecked.
- CONTINUE/QUICK_REF messaging must be updated whenever priorities change; forgetfulness here will erode the self-hydrating flow.
- Audit sinks outside the demos should migrate to the bootstrap/audit helpers to avoid pre-frame noise; track drift as new surfaces appear.

## Notes for Next Agent
- Prefer editing docs through the new paths; avoid recreating process files in the repo root.
- Validator maintenance guidance lives in `docs/procs/PROCESS.md`; extend that section whenever you change `bin/validate-docs.sh`.
- After completing the reference sweep, rerun `./bin/validate-docs.sh` and record the pass here.
- When sprint items close, move them into `docs/procs/DONE.md` with timestamps so the validator's silence reflects reality.
- For audit work, review `examples/audit_demo.rs` first—the Boxy layout shows expected formatting once the placeholder lands and now demonstrates the audit bootstrap helper in practice. See `examples/bootstrap_helper.rs` and `examples/workshop_room_bootstrap.rs` for scripted bootstrap/control usage.
- New `LegacyScreenStrategy` lives in `runtime::screens`; follow the `chat_demo` wiring as the canonical example until more demos migrate.
- `bin/examples.sh run <example>` continues to work for the migrated demos; use `cargo check --example <name>` if you need a non-interactive compile check.
