# Continue Log – main · Runtime Audit & First-Paint Prototypes

## Summary
- Landed SCREEN-106: added `examples/workshop_screen_multiscreen.rs` to exercise dashboard/settings/activity flows with shared state, plus the companion guide in `docs/ref/workshops/workshop_screen_multiscreen.md`.
- Updated README, QUICK_REF, SPRINT, TASKS, CONTINUE, DONE, and META_PROCESS to reflect the new workshop and close out SCREEN-106 in the backlog.
- Multi-screen navigation now has an end-to-end workshop; remaining runtime work focuses on validation across terminals and Boxy workshop hygiene.

## Current Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Phase**: Runtime & Plugin Phase 2 (observability + first paint prototypes)
- **Progress**: Audit + bootstrap infrastructure is stable; screen manager and navigation helpers are live across demos; documentation and onboarding material now match the new runtime surface; remaining work centres on multi-screen education and workshop hardening.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Close WORKSHOP-201A by addressing the Boxy dashboard workshop defects and updating the guide with troubleshooting notes.
2. Outline WORKSHOP-301 (first paint performance) with fresh `cargo bench --bench runtime` baselines once 201A is stable.
3. Feed multi-screen learnings back into `docs/ref/strat/SCREEN_ZONE_STRATEGY.md` (patterns, navigator usage) after follow-up testing results arrive.

## Blockers / Risks
- Cross-terminal behaviour for the audit/bootstrap demos is still unverified; the UAT sweep is logged as BACKLOG item ROOM-UAT-001 until we schedule it.
- Boxy workshop defects (WORKSHOP-201A) remain unresolved; they could confuse newcomers now that docs emphasise the workshop path.
- Bootstrap/audit helpers must stay the default path—any new demo that bypasses them will reintroduce pre-render log spam.

## Notes for Next Agent
- All process docs now live under `docs/procs/*.md`; README + META_PROCESS were updated to reflect the structure—mirror that pattern for future guidance.
- If you add new critical docs, extend `bin/validate-docs.sh` and note the change in `docs/procs/PROCESS.md`.
- Keep logging completions in `docs/procs/DONE.md` once sprint items land; validator silence depends on it.
- For audit/screen work, start with `examples/audit_demo.rs` and `examples/workshop_screen_navigation.rs`; `bin/examples.sh run <example>` remains the quickest smoke harness.
- The new `examples/workshop_screen_multiscreen.rs` pairs with `docs/ref/workshops/workshop_screen_multiscreen.md`—use it to demo shared state + navigator flows when onboarding.
- UAT debt sits in `docs/procs/BACKLOG.md` (ROOM-UAT-001); update CONTINUE once we schedule or complete the sweep.
- Bootstrap helpers (`examples/bootstrap_helper.rs`, `examples/workshop_room_bootstrap.rs`) show how to gate renders; ensure any new demo opts into them before measuring audit output.
