# Continue Log – main · Meta-Process Rollout

## Summary
- Documented validator maintenance expectations in `docs/procs/PROCESS.txt` and confirmed the script remains silent-success.
- Scaffolded meta-process layout: created `docs/procs/`, `docs/ref/`, and `.analysis/` directories.
- Migrated roadmap, tasks, backlog, and reference notes into the new structure.
- Seeded START/PROCESS/QUICK_REF stubs to orient future sessions.
- Replaced the Boxy validator with a Room-specific `bin/validate-docs.sh` that enforces the new layout.
- Added workshop backlog entries (WORKSHOP-101/201/301) scoped to current Phase 2 work.
- Completed WORKSHOP-101 via `examples/workshop_layout_fundamentals.rs` and `docs/ref/workshops/workshop_layout_fundamentals.md`.
- ROOM-META-004 legacy reference sweep confirmed only intentional mentions remain.
- Logged defects for the Boxy dashboard workshop (see WORKSHOP-201A follow-up ticket).
- Added WORKSHOP-202 grid scenario (example + guide) to accelerate future Boxy docs.

## Current Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Phase**: Runtime & Plugin Phase 2 (process rehydration focus)
- **Progress**: Directory migration and validator complete; analysis snapshots seeded; workshop backlog entries captured; reference sweep still in progress.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Start WORKSHOP-301 (First Paint Performance) planning, mirroring the pattern used for workshops 101/201.
2. Keep the validator running clean after each doc change; record outcomes in DONE.
3. Finish the lingering reference sweep so no stale pointers remain outside the core process docs.

## Blockers / Risks
- Residual stale references may exist outside the primary process docs; they could confuse the next agent if left unchecked.
- CONTINUE/QUICK_REF messaging must be updated whenever priorities change; forgetfulness here will erode the self-hydrating flow.

## Notes for Next Agent
- Prefer editing docs through the new paths; avoid recreating process files in the repo root.
- Validator maintenance guidance now lives in `docs/procs/PROCESS.txt`; extend that section when you change `bin/validate-docs.sh`.
- After completing the reference sweep, rerun `./bin/validate-docs.sh` and record any warnings here.
- When sprint items close, move them into `docs/procs/DONE.txt` with timestamps so the validator’s silence reflects reality.
