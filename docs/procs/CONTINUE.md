# Continue Log – main · Runtime Audit & First-Paint Prototypes

## Summary
- Added a lifecycle audit module (`runtime::audit`) plus runtime hooks so stages stream to custom sinks.
- Introduced `examples/runtime_first_paint.rs` to force an immediate render and spotlight audit output for onboarding.
- Replaced the prompt scratchpad with `examples/audit_demo.rs` – a Boxy dashboard that consumes the audit feed once the first frame paints.
- Wired audit re-exports through `lib.rs` and updated `chat_demo` to cover the expanded `RuntimeEvent` match.
- Logged follow-up tasks (ROOM-612/613) for formalising bootstrap helpers and default focus handling.
- Validator still passes; process docs remain the single entry points (START/PROCESS/QUICK_REF updated).

## Current Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Phase**: Runtime & Plugin Phase 2 (observability + first paint prototypes)
- **Progress**: Audit infrastructure and demos landed; pre-rendered Boxy prompts superseded by audit viewer; meta-process scaffolding stable; reference sweep still queued.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Design the bootstrap helper (ROOM-612) that can delay audit streaming until the initial frame is ready; integrate into demos once ready.
2. Spec default focus wiring (ROOM-613) so prompt-style plugins can declare their target zone without manual controllers.
3. Finish the documentation/reference sweep and record the pass in DONE once complete.
4. Exercise `audit_demo` and `runtime_first_paint` across terminals; capture any ANSI glitches as follow-up issues.

## Blockers / Risks
- Residual stale references may exist outside the primary process docs; they could confuse the next agent if left unchecked.
- CONTINUE/QUICK_REF messaging must be updated whenever priorities change; forgetfulness here will erode the self-hydrating flow.
- Audit viewer currently buffers immediately—helper work (ROOM-612) should formalise first-frame gating.

## Notes for Next Agent
- Prefer editing docs through the new paths; avoid recreating process files in the repo root.
- Validator maintenance guidance lives in `docs/procs/PROCESS.txt`; extend that section whenever you change `bin/validate-docs.sh`.
- After completing the reference sweep, rerun `./bin/validate-docs.sh` and record the pass here.
- When sprint items close, move them into `docs/procs/DONE.txt` with timestamps so the validator’s silence reflects reality.
- For audit work, review `examples/audit_demo.rs` first—the Boxy layout shows expected formatting once the placeholder lands.
