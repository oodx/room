# Sprint Log – Meta-Process Adoption (Week of 2025-09-20)

## Sprint Goal
Bring the Room project in line with the META process so future sessions self-rehydrate in under five minutes.

## Active Stories
1. [x] ROOM-META-001 · Validator realignment (2 pts)
   - Rewrote `bin/validate-docs.sh` to target Room docs, .analysis files, and eggs.
   - Silent-success behaviour preserved with staleness warnings for critical files.

2. [~] ROOM-META-002 · Process doc normalization (2 pts)
   - Core references retargeted to `docs/ref/` and `docs/procs/`.
   - Follow-up: sweep remaining docs/examples for legacy paths and keep QUICK_REF/CONTINUE synced as priorities change.

3. [x] ROOM-META-003 · Analysis hydration (1 pt)
   - Populated `.analysis/consolidated_wisdom.txt` with China’s architecture summary.
   - Captured actionable debt items in `.analysis/technical_debt.txt` sourced from TASKS/BACKLOG/eggs.

4. [x] ROOM-META-004 · Legacy reference sweep (1 pt)
   - Verified repository search only surfaces intentional mentions in process docs.
   - Ready to close out meta-process cleanup.

5. [x] WORKSHOP-101 · Layout Fundamentals Workshop (2 pts)
   - `examples/workshop_layout_fundamentals.rs` delivers three starter scenarios.
   - `docs/ref/workshops/workshop_layout_fundamentals.md` captures the walkthrough + exercises.

6. [x] WORKSHOP-201 · Boxy Dashboard Runtime Workshop (2 pts)
   - Added workshop header in `examples/boxy_dashboard_runtime.rs` with controls and guidance.
   - Documented focus/refresh/prompt exercises in `docs/ref/workshops/workshop_boxy_dashboard_runtime.md`.

7. [ ] WORKSHOP-201A · Boxy Dashboard Workshop Fixes (1 pt)
   - Track and resolve known defects in the workshop flow.
   - Update guide with troubleshooting notes once fixed.

8. [x] WORKSHOP-202 · Boxy Grid Workshop (2 pts)
   - Added `examples/workshop_boxy_grid.rs` covering 2x2 and wide strip scenarios.
   - Authored `docs/ref/workshops/workshop_boxy_grid.md` with exercises and follow-ups.

## Stretch Items
- ROOM-603/604 integration: document remaining logging + benchmarking gaps in `docs/ref/strat/LOGGING_STRATEGY.md` after validator update.
- Draft acceptance list for meta-process adoption so work can move into DONE once ROOM-META-004 lands.

## Definition of Done
- Validator passes without Boxy-era references and flags stale critical docs correctly.
- All process docs reference the new file locations; QUICK_REF and CONTINUE reflect the same priorities.
- `.analysis/` directory contains first-pass summaries feeding future automation.
- Legacy references cleaned or ticketed via ROOM-META-004.
