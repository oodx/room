🎯 CURRENT FOCUS: Harden the new meta-process layout and finish normalising Room documentation references.

📊 PROJECT STATUS
- ✅ Layout engine + runtime plugins (Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 partially delivered)
- ✅ Meta-process scaffold landed (directory migration, START/PROCESS/QUICK_REF seeded)
- ⬆️ Next major push: Observability & declarative layout groundwork once doc hygiene is stable

🚨 CRITICAL CONTEXT
- Validator now targets Room docs; treat any new warnings as blockers for handoff.
- MVP boundary unchanged: prioritise runtime stability + documentation discipline before new feature work.
- Active Phase: Runtime & Plugin Phase 2 polish with process enforcement.

📋 ACTIVE TASKS (see docs/procs/SPRINT.txt for detail)
1. Sweep remaining docs/examples for legacy `docs/` references and update as needed. ✅
2. Track Boxy workshop defects via WORKSHOP-201A and plan fixes; new grid workshop (202) is ready.
3. Keep CONTINUE/QUICK_REF aligned whenever sprint priorities shift.
4. Prepare acceptance notes so meta-process work can be moved into DONE once the validator remains green.

🏗️ ARCHITECTURE SNAPSHOT
- Primary modules: `src/runtime`, `src/layout`, `src/render`, `src/registry`
- Key examples: `examples/chat_demo.rs`, `examples/control_room.rs`
- Benchmarks: `benches/runtime.rs` with baseline `meta/snaps/runtime_*`

🛠️ COMMANDS
- Tests: `cargo test --manifest-path Cargo.toml`
- Bench baseline replay: `cargo bench --bench runtime -- --baseline phase2`
- Docs health: `./bin/validate-docs.sh`
- Chat demo smoke: `cargo run --example chat_demo`

⚡ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
1. Fold validator maintenance tips into `docs/procs/PROCESS.txt` now that the sweep closed.
2. Start outlining WORKSHOP-301 (first paint) in code + docs once WORKSHOP-201A is resolved.
3. Continue logging completed sessions in DONE to keep history tidy.
