# META_PROCESS 2.1 Documentation Standardization Migration Log
# Generated: 2025-09-21
# Purpose: Systematically standardize file extensions and naming patterns

## ANALYSIS OF CURRENT STATE

### Extension Inconsistencies Identified:
- Mixed .txt/.md usage in strategy documents (ref/)
- Mixed .txt/.md usage in process documents (procs/)
- Workshop files consistently use .md (good pattern to preserve)

### Naming Pattern Issues:
- Strategy files use mix of _STRAT vs STRATEGY suffixes
- Some files use ALL_CAPS, others use sentence case
- No consistent versioning or dating scheme

## MIGRATION PLAN

### PHASE 1: STANDARDIZE EXTENSIONS
Rule: All documentation files should use .md extension for consistency
Exception: Keep .txt for simple data files (TRADEMARKS, license files)

### ref/ Directory Changes:
BENCHMARK_STRAT.txt → BENCHMARK_STRAT.md
CORE_PLUGIN_STRATEGY.txt → CORE_PLUGIN_STRATEGY.md
FEATURES_RUNTIME_PHASE2.txt → FEATURES_RUNTIME_PHASE2.md
PLUGIN_API.txt → PLUGIN_API.md
SHARED_RUNTIME_STRAT.txt → SHARED_RUNTIME_STRAT.md
SOCKET_STRAT.txt → SOCKET_STRAT.md

### procs/ Directory Changes:
DONE.txt → DONE.md
PROCESS.txt → PROCESS.md
QUICK_REF.txt → QUICK_REF.md
ROADMAP.txt → ROADMAP.md
SPRINT.txt → SPRINT.md
TASKS.txt → TASKS.md

### PHASE 2: PRESERVE EXISTING STRUCTURE
- Keep lics/ directory as-is (license files appropriately use .txt)
- Keep workshops/ subdirectory structure intact
- Maintain archive/ subdirectory for historical records

## CROSS-REFERENCE IMPACT ANALYSIS

### High-Impact Files (Many References):
- PROCESS.txt → PROCESS.md (17 references across multiple files)
- TASKS.txt → TASKS.md (8 references)
- DONE.txt → DONE.md (7 references)
- STRATEGY.md (already .md, 6 references)

### Medium-Impact Files:
- SPRINT.txt → SPRINT.md (4 references)
- CONTINUE.md (already .md, 3 references)
- QUICK_REF.txt → QUICK_REF.md (3 references)

### Files Requiring Reference Updates After Migration:
1. docs/ref/workshops/workshop_boxy_grid.md
2. docs/ref/workshops/workshop_room_bootstrap.md
3. docs/ref/FEATURES_RUNTIME_PHASE2.txt (before its own migration)
4. docs/procs/archive/TASKS_2025-09-18.md
5. docs/procs/SPRINT.txt (before its own migration)
6. docs/procs/QUICK_REF.txt (before its own migration)
7. docs/procs/BACKLOG.md
8. docs/procs/TASKS.txt (before its own migration)
9. docs/procs/ROADMAP.txt (before its own migration)
10. docs/procs/PROCESS.txt (before its own migration)
11. docs/procs/CONTINUE.md
12. docs/ref/workshops/workshop_boxy_dashboard_runtime.md
13. docs/ref/workshops/workshop_layout_fundamentals.md

## MIGRATION EXECUTION ORDER

1. Rename all ref/ .txt files to .md
2. Rename all procs/ .txt files to .md
3. Update all cross-references in remaining files
4. Verify no broken links remain

## CONFLICTS AND CONSIDERATIONS

### No Naming Conflicts:
- All target .md filenames are unique
- No existing .md files will be overwritten

### Preserved Patterns:
- Workshop naming convention maintained
- Archive structure preserved
- License file extensions kept as .txt (appropriate)

### Risk Mitigation:
- Execute renames before reference updates to avoid temporary broken states
- Use systematic mv commands to ensure atomicity
- Track each operation for potential rollback

## POST-MIGRATION VALIDATION REQUIRED

1. Verify all cross-references point to correct new paths
2. Check that no .txt files remain in ref/ and procs/ (except archives)
3. Ensure workshop cross-references still work
4. Validate process flow documentation remains intact
