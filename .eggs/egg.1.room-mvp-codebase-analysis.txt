PROJECT IDENTITY: Room MVP - Terminal Layout Engine Runtime
ANALYZED BY: China the Summary Chicken 🐔
DATE: 2025-09-20 12:17 UTC
AGENT REQUEST: Comprehensive familiarization with Rust project structure
TARGET: /home/xnull/repos/code/rust/oodx/projects/room

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
                          📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Room MVP is a sophisticated Rust-based terminal layout engine with a plugin-
driven runtime system. It provides flicker-free terminal rendering through
constraint-based layouts, zone management, and selective updates using ANSI
cursor positioning. The project has evolved from a basic layout engine (Phase 1)
to a comprehensive runtime with plugins, shared state, and observability
features (Phase 2).

🎯 CORE PURPOSE: Enable creation of complex terminal UIs with independent zones
that update without full-screen redraws, driven by RSB token streams.

                            ❓ KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Q: What makes this different from other terminal UI libraries?
A: Room focuses on token-stream driven layouts with selective updates, avoiding
   full-screen redraws. The plugin architecture and RSB integration make it
   suitable for event-driven applications.

Q: How does the layout system work?
A: Uses constraint-based solving with support for Fixed, Percent, Min, Max, and
   Flex constraints in nested vertical/horizontal containers. Results in precise
   integer rectangles for each zone.

Q: What's the plugin system like?
A: Plugins implement RoomPlugin trait with init/event/render lifecycle hooks.
   Priority-based execution with shared state coordination. Default CLI bundle
   provides common UI patterns.

Q: How mature is the project?
A: Phase 1 (layout engine) is complete. Phase 2 (runtime/plugins) is largely
   done with ongoing work on observability. Active development with regular
   commits and comprehensive documentation.

This summary reflects the state of files reviewed on 2025-09-20. The analysis
is based on static code examination and may not reflect the complete runtime
behavior or all system dependencies. For authoritative information about current
functionality, run the test suite and examples. Additional verification through
actual compilation and execution is recommended to confirm operational status.

Some files were partially read due to length limitations, so implementation
details may be incomplete. The project appears to be under active development,
so features and APIs may evolve rapidly.

🐔 CHINA'S ASSESSMENT: This is an impressive, well-architected terminal UI
framework with clear separation of concerns and a thoughtful plugin system.
The constraint-based layout engine is particularly elegant, and the focus on
performance through selective updates shows sophisticated engineering.

The documentation is thorough and the examples demonstrate real-world usage
