               🐔 CHINA'S ROOM SYSTEM FEATURES & SCREEN ZONE STRATEGY EGG #2 🥚
================================================================================

PROJECT IDENTITY: Room MVP - Terminal Layout Engine Runtime with Screen/Zone Strategy
ANALYZED BY: China the Summary Chicken 🐔
DATE: 2025-09-21 13:42 UTC
AGENT REQUEST: System features analysis + SCREEN_ZONE_STRAT implementation review
TARGET: /home/xnull/repos/code/rust/oodx/projects/room

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
              🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: ROOM'S CURRENT STATE & PROJECTIONS
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Room MVP is a mature terminal layout engine that has completed its runtime
foundation (Phase 2) and is now architecting multi-screen capabilities
(Screen/Global Zone Strategy). The system provides flicker-free terminal
rendering, plugin-based architecture, and is preparing for revolutionary
multi-screen experiences within a single runtime instance.

CRITICAL DISCOVERY: The SCREEN_ZONE_STRAT is documented but NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
- this is a planned architectural enhancement currently in specification phase.

================================================================================
                          🏗️ CURRENT SYSTEM FEATURES
================================================================================

🚀 RUNTIME FOUNDATION (COMPLETED - PHASE 2)
-------------------------------------------
✅ RoomRuntime: Central coordinator managing layout, registry, renderer, plugins
✅ Plugin System: Event-driven hooks (on_event, before_render, after_render)
✅ Zone Registry: Manages screen regions with dirty tracking & hash-based diffing
✅ Layout Solver: Constraint-based system (Fixed, Percent, Min/Max, Flex)
✅ Renderer: ANSI-based with cursor positioning, minimal flicker updates
✅ Shared State: Cross-plugin data sharing with type-safe access
✅ Focus Management: Tab-based focus cycling across zones
✅ Bootstrap Controls: Fine-grained startup sequence control

🎮 DRIVER SYSTEMS
-----------------
✅ CLI Driver: Standard terminal input/output with crossterm integration
✅ Socket Driver: TCP-based remote automation and scripted event replay
✅ Bootstrap Helpers: First-paint control, tick gating, key-event gating

🔍 OBSERVABILITY & PERFORMANCE
------------------------------
✅ Structured Logging: JSONL output with configurable levels
✅ Runtime Metrics: FPS tracking, zone update counts, event statistics
✅ Audit System: Lifecycle instrumentation with pluggable audit sinks
✅ Benchmarking: Criterion-based performance regression detection

🧩 PLUGIN ECOSYSTEM
-------------------
✅ Default CLI Bundle: Input prompt, status bar, diagnostics display
✅ Focus Controller: Keyboard navigation between zones
✅ Lifecycle Logger: Debug event tracking
✅ Metrics Snapshot: Periodic performance data emission

                      🎬 SCREEN_ZONE_STRAT: THE FUTURE VISION
================================================================================

📋 ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATION (PLANNED)
---------------------------------------
The Screen & Global Zone Strategy introduces revolutionary multi-screen
capabilities. Here's what's coming:

🖥️ CORE CONCEPTS (DESIGNED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED):

| Component        | Responsibility |
|------------------|----------------|
| Screen           | Declarative full-screen experience definition |
| Global Zone      | Composition root plugin for screen layout |
| Panel            | Individual UI components (existing zones + plugins) |
| Screen Manager   | Runtime navigation and lifecycle orchestration |

🔄 PLANNED FLOW ARCHITECTURE:
1. Register multiple ScreenDefinition instances
2. Screen Manager activates initial screen
3. Runtime events: RoomRuntime → ScreenManager → GlobalZone → Panels
4. Screen switching tears down current, swaps layout, activates new

📝 PLANNED API DESIGN:
```rust
pub struct ScreenDefinition {
    pub id: String,
    pub title: String,
    pub strategy: Box<dyn GlobalZoneStrategy>,
    pub metadata: ScreenMetadata,
}

pub trait GlobalZoneStrategy {
    fn layout(&self) -> LayoutTree;
    fn register_panels(&mut self, runtime: &mut RoomRuntime) -> Result<()>;
    fn handle_event(&mut self, ctx: &mut RuntimeContext, event: &RuntimeEvent) -> Result<EventFlow>;
    fn on_lifecycle(&mut self, event: ScreenLifecycleEvent) -> Result<()>;
}
```

🎯 STRATEGY BENEFITS:
- Multiple full-screen layouts in single runtime
- Screen-specific state namespacing
- Navigation between different application modes
- Global zone strategies for different UI patterns (chat, browser, dashboard)

⚠️ CURRENT STATUS: SPECIFICATION ONLY
------------------------------------
The SCREEN_ZONE_STRAT exists as detailed documentation in:
- `docs/ref/SCREEN_ZONE_STRAT.md` (comprehensive strategy document)
- Referenced in `docs/procs/TASKS.txt` as MILESTONE items SCREEN-101 through SCREEN-106

NO IMPLEMENTATION EXISTS YET - This is planned future work!
