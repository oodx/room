AGENT: Room/Boxy Grid Layout Integration Team

üîç EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-------------------
The Boxy/Room integration is missing a critical Grid Layout Solver that translates abstract grid definitions into precise terminal coordinates while maintaining responsive, efficient rendering.

üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL LAYER DISCOVERY
---------------------------------
MISSING LAYER: Responsive Grid Coordinate Translation System

Key Components of the Missing Layer:
1. Dynamic Space Distribution Solver
2. Proportional Resize Mapping
3. Intelligent Dirty Zone Tracking
4. Adaptive Content Reflow Mechanism

üß© CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION VS. INTENDED DESIGN
---------------------------------------------
Current State:
- Basic grid track definitions (Fixed, Fraction, Percent)
- Manual coordinate calculations
- Rudimentary resize handling
- Limited zone state preservation

Intended Design:
- Flexible, CSS Grid-like layout engine
- Automatic space distribution across tracks
- Intelligent resize with minimal redraw overhead
- Preserving zone state and scroll positions
- Handling complex nested layouts

üö® CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL GAP
-----------------------------
The system lacks a true "Grid Solver" that:
- Converts abstract grid definitions to precise terminal coordinates
- Handles complex resize scenarios
- Tracks and minimizes rendering overhead
- Supports flexible layout strategies

üí° PROPOSED SOLUTION: GridSolver
--------------------------------
Implement a dedicated GridSolver with these capabilities:
- Two-pass layout calculation (fixed/percentage ‚Üí fractional distribution)
- Rounding error redistribution
- Intelligent dirty zone tracking
- Nested grid support
- Collapse/expand zone logic
- State preservation during resizes

üî¨ KEY IMPLEMENTATION INSIGHTS
------------------------------
1. Separation of Layout Definition from Rendering
2. Proportional Coordinate Mapping
3. Efficient Resize Algorithms
4. Minimal Redraw Strategies

‚ùì QUESTIONS RAISED
------------------
- How will nested grids be handled?
- What's the performance overhead of the proposed solver?
- How granular can zone state preservation become?

ü•ö DISCLAIMER
-------------
These insights are based on the current project documentation and may not reflect the complete system complexity. Additional verification and prototype implementation are recommended.
