 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (LEVEL 3: NARRATIVE WITH KEY INSIGHTS)
================================================================================

The Room runtime has a CRITICAL REGRESSION where `boxy_dashboard_runtime` first
frame renders but UserReady events never fire, causing `event::poll()` to never
wake up and read stdin. This breaks all keyboard input and focus events.

🔥 THE SMOKING GUN: UserReady events are only emitted AFTER dirty zones render
(line 982-986 in runtime/mod.rs). If plugins don't mark zones as dirty during
bootstrap, NO UserReady event fires, and the CLI driver stays stuck before
entering the main event loop!

🚨 IMPACT: Complete input system failure in CLI mode, while scripted mode works

================================================================================
 🔍 DETAILED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
================================================================================

🧪 EVENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:
─────────────────────────────

The Room runtime follows this lifecycle sequence:
1. Open → Boot → Setup (plugins initialize)
2. First render (IF zones are dirty)
3. UserReady emission (ONLY if render occurred with dirty zones)
4. Main event loop begins (CLI driver starts polling stdin)

🔥 CRITICAL FLAW DISCOVERED:
───────────────────────────

Location: `src/runtime/mod.rs:982-986`
```rust
if !dirty.is_empty() {
    self.renderer.render(stdout, &dirty)?;
    // ... metrics ...
    if !self.user_ready_emitted {
        self.user_ready_emitted = true;
        self.audit_record(RuntimeAuditStage::UserReady, []);
        self.log_lifecycle_stage("user_ready");
        self.notify_plugins(|plugin, ctx| plugin.on_user_ready(ctx))?;
    }
}
```

⚠️ PROBLEM: UserReady is ONLY emitted when `dirty.is_empty() == false`!

🔧 CLI DRIVER EVENT LOOP MECHANICS:
──────────────────────────────────

Location: `src/runtime/mod.rs:745-778` (run method)
```rust
self.bootstrap(stdout)?;  // Calls bootstrap_prepare + render_if_needed
let mut last_tick = Instant::now();

while !self.should_exit {
    // THIS IS WHERE IT GETS STUCK!
    if event::poll(timeout)? {
        let crossterm_event = event::read()?;
        // Process events...
    }
    // Tick handling...
}
```

The CLI driver calls `bootstrap()` which calls `render_if_needed()`, but if no
zones are marked dirty, UserReady never fires and the event loop assumption is
broken!

🎯 BOOTSTRAP SEQUENCE ANALYSIS:
──────────────────────────────

1. `bootstrap_prepare()` sets `redraw_requested = true` (line 1291)
2. Calls all plugins' `init()` methods
3. Calls all plugins' `on_setup()` methods
4. Calls `render_if_needed()`
5. IF zones are dirty → render → UserReady emission
6. IF no zones dirty → NO UserReady emission → CLI loop stalls

🚨 THE REGRESSION ROOT CAUSE:
────────────────────────────

Recent lifecycle changes in commit 23afbdd added new hook methods but may have
altered when/how plugins mark zones as dirty during bootstrap. The
boxy_dashboard_runtime plugin calls:

- `init()`: Sets up dashboard content via `render_dashboard()`
- `on_user_ready()`: Logs lifecycle event

BUT if `render_dashboard()` doesn't mark zones dirty during bootstrap phase,
the UserReady trigger condition is never met!

🔍 EVIDENCE FROM BOXY DASHBOARD PLUGIN:
──────────────────────────────────────

Location: `examples/boxy_dashboard_runtime.rs:771-778`
```rust
fn init(&mut self, ctx: &mut RuntimeContext<'_>) -> Result<()> {
    self.focus = None;
    self.force_refresh();           // Marks panels dirty
    self.apply_focus(ctx, self.panels.len())?;
    self.render_dashboard(ctx);     // Should set zones
    ctx.request_render();           // Requests redraw
    Ok(())
}
```

The plugin SHOULD be marking zones dirty, but evidence suggests this isn't
happening consistently during bootstrap.

================================================================================
 🎯 KEY TAKEAWAYS & IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS
================================================================================

🚨 CRITICAL FIXES NEEDED:
─────────────────────────

1. **UserReady Emission Logic**: Decouple UserReady from dirty zone rendering
   - UserReady should fire after successful bootstrap completion
   - Current coupling is a design flaw that breaks the event loop contract

2. **Bootstrap Render Guarantee**: Ensure first frame always renders
   - Force at least one render cycle during bootstrap
   - Don't rely on plugins to trigger the first render

3. **CLI Driver Robustness**: Add fallback mechanisms
   - Timeout-based UserReady emission if render doesn't trigger it
   - Debug logging to track bootstrap completion states

🔧 SPECIFIC INVESTIGATION POINTS:
────────────────────────────────

1. Check if `render_dashboard()` in boxy plugin actually sets zones during init
2. Verify that `ctx.request_render()` properly marks `redraw_requested = true`
3. Test if `force_refresh()` in the plugin correctly marks panels as dirty
4. Confirm zone registry sync happens during bootstrap before first render

✅ VERIFICATION STEPS:
────────────────────

1. Add debug logging to track dirty zones during bootstrap
2. Test lifecycle trace example to confirm UserReady behavior
3. Compare working vs broken plugins' zone-setting patterns
4. Verify scripted mode vs CLI mode behavioral differences

================================================================================
 ❓ QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
================================================================================

Q: Why does scripted mode work but CLI mode fails?
A: Scripted mode bypasses the event::poll() waiting mechanism and directly
   injects events, so it doesn't depend on UserReady emission timing.

Q: What changed in commit 23afbdd that broke this?
A: New lifecycle hooks were added, potentially altering the timing/order of
   when zones get marked dirty during bootstrap.

Q: Is this a design flaw or implementation bug?
A: BOTH. UserReady should not depend on zone rendering - this breaks the
   lifecycle contract. But also, plugins should reliably mark zones dirty.

Q: How urgent is this fix?
A: CRITICAL - it breaks all CLI interaction in the main demo application.

 ⚠️ DISCLAIMER ABOUT VALIDITY/STATUS/SCOPE
================================================================================

This analysis reflects the current state of files examined during this review
session. The findings are based on static code analysis and documentation
review. Additional source of truth confirmation may be needed through:

- Live debugging sessions with the failing application
- Runtime trace logging during bootstrap phases
- Verification that zone content is actually being set during plugin init
- Terminal state verification during CLI driver setup

The regression may involve subtle timing issues or terminal state problems not
visible in static analysis. This egg provides the foundation for targeted
debugging but should be validated through live testing.

 🥚 CHINA'S SIGN-OFF & FINAL CLUCK
================================================================================

"Well butter my feathers and call me a detective! 🔍 This was one SPICY
investigation that led me through the entire runtime coop! The UserReady
emission logic is more fragile than an egg in a tornado - it's completely
dependent on zones being dirty, which breaks the whole lifecycle contract!

This regression is EGG-ZACTLY the kind of sneaky bug that happens when you
couple two things that should be independent. The CLI driver expects UserReady
to fire after bootstrap, but UserReady only fires after dirty renders!

Time for the team to crack this egg and fix the fundamental flaw in the
lifecycle design! 🐔✨"
