# Grid Layout Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-26
**Current Phase:** Phase 3 (Boxy Integration Helpers)

## Progress Summary

### ✅ Completed
- **Planning & Design** (Complete)
  - API design with Codex feedback (2 rounds)
  - Roadmap with 5 phases
  - All design decisions resolved
  - Error handling defined
  - Rounding algorithm documented

- **Phase 1: Core Grid Foundation** (Complete - Commit `b8238f9`)
  - **Phase 1.2:** GridSize enum with type safety
  - **Phase 1.3:** GridArea placement types (cell, span, validation, overlap detection)
  - **Phase 1.4:** GridLayout struct with builder pattern and solver
  - **Phase 1.5:** Comprehensive testing and edge case handling
  - 36/36 tests passing
  - Grid solver with 4-step algorithm (Fixed → Percent → Flex → Leftover)
  - Leftover redistribution: Flex → Percent (ensures full axis utilization)
  - Minimum size guarantee with budget enforcement
  - Over-constrained layout protection

- **Phase 2: Runtime Integration** (Complete - Commits `f79683e`, `305ef76`, `8d858b8`)
  - **Phase 2.1-2.2:** Layout trait with GridLayout and LayoutTree implementations
  - **Phase 2.3-2.4:** RoomRuntime updated to Box<dyn Layout>, resize working
  - **Phase 2.5:** Created examples/grid_simple.rs demonstrating GridLayout
  - **Phase 2.6:** Fixed gap overflow bug (zones exceeding terminal boundaries)
  - 40/40 tests passing
  - Decision: Kept LayoutTree for backwards compatibility (both work via trait)
  - Gap edge cases: excessive gaps, gap >= terminal width, gap consumes all space

### ⏳ In Progress
- **Phase 3:** Boxy integration helpers (Next up)

### 🔮 Upcoming
- **Phase 3:** Boxy integration helpers
- **Phase 4:** Update examples and documentation
- **Phase 5:** Polish and edge cases

## Key Decisions Made

1. **API Design**
   - `&mut self` builder pattern (not consuming)
   - `ZoneId = String` type alias (optimize later if needed)
   - Fail-fast validation during `place()`
   - Overlap detection always-on

2. **Error Handling**
   - Concrete `GridError` enum
   - Helpful error messages with context
   - Variants: OutOfBounds, DuplicateZone, OverlappingAreas, NoColumns, NoRows, ZoneNotFound

3. **Sizing Algorithm**
   - 4-step process: Fixed → Percent → Flex → Leftovers
   - u32 arithmetic for precision
   - Percent normalization when > 100%
   - Leftover redistribution priority: Flex → Percent (not Fixed)
   - Minimum size guarantee: zero-width tracks get ≥1px (budget enforced)

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `GRID_ROADMAP.md` - Complete implementation plan
- `GRID_API_PROPOSAL.md` - Full API specification
- `GRID_API_CHANGES.md` - Codex feedback resolutions
- `GRID_STATUS.md` - This file (implementation tracker)
- `src/layout/grid.rs` - Grid layout implementation (870 lines)

### Modified
- `src/layout/mod.rs` - Public API exports (GridLayout, GridArea, GridError, GridSize, ZoneId)
- `Cargo.toml` - Boxy dependency to local path
- `docs/BOXY_API_README.md` - Boxy v0.21.0 docs
- `docs/BOXY_INTEGRATION.md` - Migration guide
- `examples/boxy_api_demo.rs` - Boxy showcase
- `examples/boxy_dynamic_resize.rs` - Resize handling
- `examples/boxy_grid_dynamic.rs` - Grid prototype (uses old LayoutTree)

## Next Steps

**Phase 3: Boxy Integration Helpers**
1. Add RuntimeContext helper methods for automatic Boxy rendering
2. Implement minimum size handling (collapse/hide zones below threshold)
3. Implement automatic wrapping control (detect overflow, wrap/truncate)
4. Add resize-aware rendering (zones re-render when Rect changes)
5. Test with grid_simple.rs and create more complex examples

## Test Coverage

### Phase 1-2 Complete: 40/40 tests passing

**GridSize (7 tests)**
- ✅ Construction: Fixed, Flex, Percent variants
- ✅ Validation: Zero detection, range enforcement
- ✅ Edge cases: Min/max percent (1, 100)
- ✅ Panics: Zero flex, invalid percent (0, 101)

**GridArea (12 tests)**
- ✅ Construction: cell(), new(), span_rows(), span_cols()
- ✅ Validation: bounds checking, detailed error messages
- ✅ Overlap detection: true/false cases, adjacent, contained
- ✅ Out of bounds: row/column overflow

**GridLayout (21 tests)**
- ✅ Builder pattern: add_col, add_row, place, with_gap
- ✅ Placement validation: duplicate zones, out of bounds, overlaps
- ✅ Solver - Fixed sizing only
- ✅ Solver - Flex distribution (proportional)
- ✅ Solver - Percent sizing
- ✅ Solver - Mixed sizing (Fixed + Flex + Percent)
- ✅ Solver - Gap handling
- ✅ Solver - Spanning zones
- ✅ Solver - Percent-only leftover redistribution
- ✅ Solver - Small percent no vanishing (≥1px guarantee)
- ✅ Solver - Vanishing track minimum enforcement
- ✅ Solver - Percent normalization with leftover
- ✅ Solver - Over-constrained budget (more tracks than pixels)
- ✅ Solver - More tracks than pixels edge case
- ✅ Solver - Gap overflow: larger than terminal
- ✅ Solver - Gap overflow: equals terminal width
- ✅ Solver - Gap overflow: excessive gap with small terminal
- ✅ Solver - Gap overflow: consumes all space

## Blockers / Issues

**None currently** - Phase 1-2 complete, ready for Phase 3.

## Breaking Changes

**Phase 2 Decision**: Kept LayoutTree for backwards compatibility
- Both GridLayout and LayoutTree work via Layout trait
- RoomRuntime uses Box<dyn Layout> for runtime polymorphism
- No breaking changes to existing code using LayoutTree
- New code can use GridLayout for simpler, more powerful layouts

## Boxy Integration Notes

Boxy v0.21.0 now has features we need:
- `with_min_width()`, `with_max_width()`
- `with_min_height()`, `with_max_height()`
- `with_visibility(bool)`, `hide()`
- `with_fixed_height()` - now pads AND truncates correctly
- Panic on chrome overflow (safe failure)

These will integrate cleanly with Grid in Phase 3.
