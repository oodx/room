# Docs Needing Updates After Compact

## Immediate Updates Needed

1. **GRID_ROADMAP.md**
   - [ ] Mark Phase 1.2 as complete (GridSize enum)
   - [ ] Update timeline estimate (subtract 1 day)
   - [ ] Add reference to GRID_STATUS.md

2. **GRID_API_PROPOSAL.md**
   - [ ] Update approval checklist to show Phase 1.2 complete
   - [ ] Add "Implementation Progress" section at top

3. **GRID_API_CHANGES.md**
   - [ ] Update "Implementation Status" section
   - [ ] Mark Phase 1.2 complete
   - [ ] Update "Files Changed" to include grid.rs

## Context for Next Session

### What Was Accomplished
- Grid API fully designed and approved (2 rounds Codex feedback)
- Phase 1.2 complete: GridSize enum implemented with tests
- Boxy integration discovered (min/max width/height, visibility controls)
- All design decisions resolved (gap, validation, overlaps, percent handling)

### Current State
- **File:** `src/layout/grid.rs` (138 lines)
- **Tests:** 7/7 passing (GridSize variants, validation, panics)
- **Module:** Exported via `src/layout/mod.rs`
- **Next:** Phase 1.3 - Implement GridArea placement types

### Key Context to Preserve

**GridSize enum is type-safe:**
```rust
pub enum GridSize {
    Fixed(u16),
    Flex(NonZeroU16),    // Cannot be zero
    Percent(NonZeroU8),  // 1-100 only
}
```

**Convenience constructors panic on invalid input:**
```rust
GridSize::flex(0);      // Panics: "Flex size must be non-zero"
GridSize::percent(0);   // Panics: "Percent must be 1-100"
GridSize::percent(101); // Panics: "Percent must be 1-100"
```

**Next task (GridArea) needs:**
- `struct GridArea { rows: Range<usize>, cols: Range<usize> }`
- Methods: `cell()`, `span_rows()`, `span_cols()`, `new()`
- `validate(&zone, row_count, col_count) -> Result<Self, GridError>`
- `overlaps(&other) -> bool`
- Must pass zone reference to validation (avoid ownership issues)

**Algorithm to implement (Phase 1.4 solver):**
1. Fixed tracks - reserve space
2. Percent tracks - convert to u32, normalize if >100%
3. Flex tracks - distribute remaining space
4. Leftovers - add to leftmost Flex tracks

### Files to Reference
- **GRID_API_PROPOSAL.md** - Complete spec (lines 87-102 for GridArea)
- **GRID_ROADMAP.md** - Phase breakdown
- **GRID_STATUS.md** - Current progress tracker
- **src/layout/grid.rs** - Current implementation

### Commands to Run
```bash
# Run grid tests
cargo test --lib grid::tests

# Check compilation
cargo check --lib

# Run all examples (after Phase 2)
cargo run --example boxy_grid_dynamic
```

## Notes for Continuation

- Commits: `ef204ff` (design), `3dcb96e` (refinements), `264ffbd` (Codex round 2), `b31937e` (GridSize)
- Boxy is at local path (not git) for development
- No breaking changes yet (Phase 2)
- All tests must pass before next phase
- Compact incoming - this doc preserves context
