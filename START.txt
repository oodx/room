 🚀 ROOM MVP – START HERE
================================================================================

👋 Welcome to the Room MVP runtime project.

📋 Single Entry Point: Read `docs/procs/PROCESS.md` to understand the workflow system.

🎯 Quick Start (≈5 minutes)
1. Open `docs/procs/PROCESS.md` for the full self-hydrating workflow guide.
2. Scan `docs/procs/CONTINUE.md` to pick up the latest session state.
3. Review `docs/procs/SPRINT.md` for the active iteration plan.
4. Check `docs/procs/QUICK_REF.md` if you just need the essentials.

⚡ Ultra-Fast Start (≈30 seconds)
→ Jump straight to `docs/procs/QUICK_REF.md` for the current focus, blockers, and key commands.

🔍 System Health Check
→ Run `./bin/validate-docs.sh` to verify documentation integrity before or after work.

📁 Process documents live exclusively in `docs/procs/`; reference material lives in `docs/ref/`; analysis artifacts are kept in `.analysis/` and `.eggs/`.

🛠️ Need code context quickly?
→ See `docs/ref/strat/LAYOUT_ENGINE_STRATEGY.md` for architecture, `docs/ref/PLUGIN_API.md` for plugin guidance, and `docs/ref/strat/RUNTIME_STRATEGY.md` for runtime flow.

Stay disciplined: update `docs/procs/CONTINUE.md` and rerun the validator at the end of every session.
