//! Runtime lifecycle audit utilities (RSB MODULE_SPEC compliant).
//!
//! This module provides lightweight instrumentation hooks so callers can observe
//! the major lifecycle transitions of `RoomRuntime`. Records capture a stage
//! identifier plus structured metadata so downstream code can log, buffer, or
//! visualize the runtimeâ€™s progression without contorting the core loop.
